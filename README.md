# This is title

## What is this?
- This is the lessons/exercises from Codility, basically being used to train logical thinking of programming and efficiency by the algorithm
- Mainly being used for code test to entry job hunting process

## What is Original Files folder?
- The original repository is always credit to https://github.com/madhurir23/Codility
- I do not own anything, my purpose is only to make the C# language implemention
- Why I do this? Because I use Unity, and it uses .NET / C# language so I want to learn based on this language

## Why not other language?
- You are right!
- Because recently I focus on using Unity, I want to train more using C#
- If you familiar with Python, please use and do it by yourself

## Where can I found the Codility test, or whatever you said?
- https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/
- Link above is the first lesson/exercise, you can check the other tasks

## How to use these codes?
- I am sorry to say but since I use Unity, I usually copy-paste the code which I run through Unity to this repository
- I make a .cs script on Unity, run it through any GameObject, and check if it run well as well in Codility
- I believe the original creator is already create all these codes carefully, since he has Golden award!
- If you can use .NET compiler through Visual Studio Code, that's perfect!

## What will you do after this?
- I use these codes to check if my own code is already good, in short to clarify and learn what is the best practice does
